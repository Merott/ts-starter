# next-starter

This is a simple and minimal starter project for Next.js with Bun.

It comes with TypeScript, as well as ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest, which are my go-to tools for linting, formatting, and testing TypeScript code.

## How to use

```bash
git clone -b next-app --single-branch --depth 1 git@github.com:Merott/ts-starter.git my-nextjs-project
cd my-nextjs-project
bun install
bun run dev
open "http://localhost:3000"
```
